# rental_sys
Command line video rental system that was built for an Object Oriented Programming course, the program allows accounts to be created and for users to rent out dvd and games, while automatically managing the inventory of the store. The classes are structured to allow inheritance of the common behaviour between different stock types. A testing harness was created to automate integration testing and unit testing.
